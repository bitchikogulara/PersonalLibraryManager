# Personal Library Manager  

A simple iOS app built with SwiftUI to help you track your books—whether you’re reading, want to read, or have finished reading.  

## Purpose  
This app was developed as the **final project** for a **Swift course** organized by **GITA and New Horizons**.  
The course was led by trainer **Emil Asaturov**.  

## Features  
- Organize books into **Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read** categories.  
- Add and edit book details, including **title, author, cover, status, and notes**.  
- Track reading progress with a **progress bar** for "Currently Reading" books.  
- Deleted books move to a **Recycle Bin** and are permanently removed after 4 weeks.  
- Upload cover images using the **Photo Picker**.  

## Note  
This project is subject to future refinement. I plan to continue improving the app, making it more polished, and adding new features over time.  
Feel free to **contribute** or **suggest improvements!**
